# Times Tables Trainer (Streamlit)

A calm, mobile-first trainer for multiplication tables:
- Randomised questions, with min/max tables.
- Per-question timer bar (top) and session timer bar (bottom).
- On-screen keypad; auto-submit when the answer reaches the right number of digits.
- Clear visual feedback (red solid on wrong; green dashed on correct).
- Spaced repetition: a missed item reappears after 2–4 other questions; if wrong twice, it won’t reappear this session and is highlighted in the report.
- Adaptive timing: per-question limit adjusts ±10% based on answer speed and accuracy (2–30 s, saved between sessions).

## Run locally
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m streamlit run times_tables_streamlit.py
```

## Mobile layout

The app keeps four keypad rows visible on phones like the Pixel 7a/9a by removing non‑essential chrome, shrinking the timers, using dynamic viewport units (`100dvh` with a `100vh` fallback), and clamping the keypad pane to `height: clamp(248px, 40dvh, 320px)`.

## Local data & TTL

The app stores your settings in the browser's `localStorage` under `tt.settings.v1`. Each change or start refreshes a 30‑day expiry. Data is scoped per device/browser and, in development, per port. If Streamlit restarts on a new port, previous settings won't be found (normal). To inspect or clear data, open the **Settings** screen, enable **Debug storage**, and use the provided buttons.
